Abstract<br>
We show that spherical/circular symmetry breaks topologically massive gravity (TMG) down<br>
to the separate vanishing of its constituent Einstein and Cotton sectors, effectively reducing it to<br>GR alone, since GR implies vanishing Cotton tensor. Consequences include Birkhoff's theorem<br>(time-independence), verified here for D = 3 GR, and absence of novel "Schwarzschild-TMG"<br>metrics: only the GR solutions­conical spaces or their cosmological extensions, are allowed.<br>

Introduction<br>
Topologically massive gravity [1] and its cosmological extension [2] (collectively TMG) have always<br>been counter-examples to much of our standard lore due to the synergy between its separately<br>anemic Einstein and Cotton sectors in D = 3: GR implies flat or (AS)dS, pure Cotton implies<br>the weaker conformally flat, space. Here, we will study the flip side, the case when the full model<br>necessarily reduces to its separate parts, and its consequences. Specifically, we will see that circular<br>

symmetry has precisely the effect of splitting the single TMG equation into its two constituents.<br>This will first be exploited to prove Birkhoff's theorem (B), which states that there is no monopole<br>radiation in theories, in particular Maxwell's and Einstein's, that are devoid of monopole degrees<br>of freedom [3]. There, gauge invariance leaves only massless helicity (±1,±2) modes respectively.<br>
Their massive extensions, having helicity 0 excitations, do permit radial radiation. Topologically<br>massive vector (TME) and tensor (TMG) D = 3 models partake of both camps: they are gauge<br>invariant, but have massive excitations. One would nevertheless expect them to obey B because,<br>although massive, they have (single) helicities (1, 2) but not 0. As a warmup, we first establish B<br>in TME and linearized TMG, then do so for full nonlinear TMG.<br>
As was also previously noted in [4], sector-splitting implies absence of "Schwarzschild-TMG"<br>
solutions beyond those of GR. There, it was shown more generally that splitting occurs in the<br>presence of a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector Xµ; our circular symmetry is the physically<br>important concrete example, with Xµ = gµ.<br>
