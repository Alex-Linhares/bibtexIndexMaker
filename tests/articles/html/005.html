Entanglement is often verified by a violation of an inequality like a Bell inequality or an entan-<br>
glement witness. Considerable effort has been devoted to the optimization of such inequalities in<br>order to obtain a high violation. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that such an<br>optimization does not necessarily lead to a better entanglement test, if the statistical error is taken<br>into account. Theoretically, we show for different error models that reducing the violation of an in-<br>equality can improve the significance. Experimentally, we observe this phenomenon in a four-photon<br>experiment, testing the Mermin and Ardehali inequality for different levels of noise.<br>
Introduction -- Quantum theory is a statistical theory,<br>
