Earth-alkaline-like atoms with ultra-narrow transitions open the door to a new regime of cavity<br>
quantum electrodynamics. That regime is characterized by a critical photon number that is many<br>orders of magnitude smaller than what can be achieved in conventional systems. We show that it is<br>possible to achieve superradiance in steady state with such systems. We discuss the basic underlying<br>mechanisms as well as the key experimental requirements.<br>

Superradiance, first introduced by Dicke over 50 years<br>
(a)<br>
<br>
ago [1], is one of the pillars of cavity quantum electrody-<br>
<br>
namics (CQED). Superradiance occurs due to the con-<br>
|e<br>
<br>
structive interference of the probability amplitudes for<br>
|g<br>
spontaneous decay of several atoms. Due to its general-<br>ity and conceptual simplicity it is a paradigm system for<br>collective behavior. Usually superradiance is transient;<br>atoms initially prepared in the excited state relax to the<br>
c<br>
ground state rapidly and the collective emission termi-<br>nates. To date superradiance has not been achieved in<br>a continuous fashion. The goal of this letter is to show<br>

that steady-state superradiance can be achieved with ul-<br>

and consequently the superradiant emission must cease.<br>
Besides being of fundamental importance, steady state<br>
superradiant systems are also interesting because of their<br>
|g decay with rate c = C through the mode of a cavity,<br>
potential applications. The most immediate application<br>
where C = g2/() is the single atom cooperativity pa-<br>
is the possibility to build active optical clocks where the<br>
