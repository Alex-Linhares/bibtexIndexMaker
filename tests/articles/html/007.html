We propose to use the quantum Fisher information in characterizing the information flow of<br>
open quantum systems. This information-theoretic approach provides a quantitative measure to<br>statistically distinguish Markovian and non-Markovian processes. A basic relation between the<br>QFI flow and non-Markovianity is unveiled for quantum dynamics of open systems. For a class<br>of time-local master equations, the exactly-analytic solution shows that the non-Markovianity is<br>characterized by additive information sub-flows in different non-Markovian channels.<br>
