ABSTRACT<br>
We invert directly the redshift - luminosity distribution of observed long Swift GRBs<br>
to obtain their rate and luminosity function. Our best fit rate is described by a broken<br>
power law that rises like (1+z)2.1+0.5<br>
-0.6 for 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 and decrease like (1+z)-1.4+2.4<br>
-1.0<br>
for z &gt; 3. This transition begins earlier and its amplitude is somewhat smaller than<br>
the corresponding transition in the SFR. The local rate is 0<br>
1.3+0.6<br>
-<br>
[Gpc-3yr-1].<br>
0.7<br>
The luminosity function is well described by a broken power law with a break at<br>
L<br>
1052.5±0.2[erg/sec] and with indices  = 0.2+0.2<br>

and  = 1.4+0.3. The<br>
0.1<br>
-0.6<br>
recently detected GRB 090423, with redshift  8, fits nicely into the model's pre-<br>
diction, verifying that we are allowed to extend our results to high redshifts. For<br>
non evolving luminosity functions we can rule out a GRB rate that follows the star<br>
formation rate (SFR), unless the latter is steeply rising at large redshifts.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short and intense pulses of soft -rays. In this work we study their<br>
luminosity function and their cosmic rate. Knowing these functions would help us understanding<br>
the nature of GRBs and determine their progenitors. This may also shed light on the still mysteri-<br>
ous physics of the central engine.<br>
The luminosity function and the rate are observationally entangled as the observed rate is a<br>
convolution of the luminosity function with the cosmic rate. For this reason, almost every work<br>
before this paper must had a-priori assumptions on at least one of these functions. At first - having<br>
no motivation to belive otherwise - the rate was assumed to be constant. The simplest form for the<br>
luminosity function was a standard candle i.e. a constant luminosity. The early studies used the<br>
