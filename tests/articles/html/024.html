<b>Abstract. </b>In this paper, we present a scheduling scheme to estimate the<br>turnaround time of parallel jobs on a heterogeneous and non-dedicated cluster<br>or NoW(Network of Workstations). This scheme is based on an analytical pre-<br>diction model that establishes the processing and communication slowdown of<br>the execution times of the jobs based on the cluster nodes and links powerful and<br>occupancy. Preservation of the local application responsiveness is also a goal.<br>
We address the impact of inaccuracies in these estimates on the overall system<br>
performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that job scheduling benefits from the<br>accuracy of these estimates. The applicability of our proposal has been proved<br>by measuring the efficiency of our method by comparing the predicted deviations<br>of the parallel jobs in a real environment with respect to the most representative<br>ones of the literature.<br>
The additional cost of obtaining these was also evaluated and compared.<br>
The present work is implemented within the CISNE project, a previously devel-<br>oped scheduling framework for non-dedicated and heterogeneous cluster<br>environments.<br>

<b>Introduction</b><br>
Several studies [1] have revealed that a high percentage of the computing resources<br>in NoWs and Clusters environments are idle. The possibility of using this computing<br>power to execute parallel jobs without perturbing the performance of the local users<br>applications on each workstation has led to a proposal for new job schedulers [6, 7, 15].<br>
With the aim of taking advantage of the idle computing resources available across<br>
the cluster, in a previous work [6], we developed a new scheduling environment, named<br>CISNE. Entering jobs wait in an input queue to be scheduled and mapped into the<br>cluster. The Scheduler supports backfilling and mapping techniques based on predic-<br>tion of the turnaround time of parallel jobs. The prediction engine is a simulation<br>tool, integrated into the CISNE scheduling system. Estimation of the future state of<br>the NoW/Cluster is a critical component of our scheduling environment. It was also so<br>in other well-known systems, as in [2, 3, 12, 13].<br>
The first step to estimate the future cluster state is to predict the job run times. In this<br>
sense, there are a large number of proposals. The most widely used method is based on a<br>
