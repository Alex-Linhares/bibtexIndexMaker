Abstract. We describe an alternative construction of an existing canon-<br>ical representation for definite Horn theories, the Guigues-Duquenne ba-<br>sis (or GD basis), which minimizes a natural notion of implicational size.<br>We extend the canonical representation to general Horn, by providing a<br>reduction from definite to general Horn CNF. We show how this repre-<br>sentation relates to two topics in query learning theory: first, we show<br>that a well-known algorithm by Angluin, Frazier and Pitt that learns<br>Horn CNF always outputs the GD basis independently of the counterex-<br>amples it receives; second, we build strong polynomial certificates for<br>Horn CNF directly from the GD basis.<br>

Introduction<br>
The present paper is the result of an attempt to better understand the classic<br>algorithm by Angluin, Frazier, and Pitt [2] that learns propositional Horn for-<br>mulas. A number of intriguing questions remain open regarding this algorithm;<br>in particular, we were puzzled by the following one: along a run of the algo-<br>rithm, queries made by the algorithm depend heavily upon the counterexamples<br>selected as answers to the previous queries. It is therefore natural to expect<br>the outcome of the algorithm to depend on the answers received along the run.<br>However, attempts at providing an example of such behavior consistently fail.<br>
In this paper we prove that such attempts must in fact fail: we describe a<br>
canonical representation of Horn functions in terms of implications, and show<br>that the algorithm of [2] always outputs this particular representation. It turns<br>out that this canonical representation is well-known in the field of Formal Con-<br>cepts, and bears the name of the authors that, to the best of our knowledge,<br>first described it: the Guigues-Duquenne basis or GD basis [7, 12]. In addition,<br>the GD basis has the important quality of being of minimum size.<br>
The GD basis is defined for definite Horn formulas only. We extend the notion<br>
of GD basis to general Horn formulas by means of a reduction from general to<br>
