<A name=1></a>Lorentz symmetry violation, dark matter and dark energy<br>

Taking into account the experimental results of the HiRes and AUGER collaborations, the present status of<br>
bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) patterns is discussed. Although significant constraints will emerge,<br>a wide range of models and values of parameters will still be left open. Cosmological implications of allowed<br>LSV patterns are discussed focusing on the origin of our Universe, the cosmological constant, dark matter and<br>dark energy. Superbradyons (superluminal preons) may be the actual constituents of vacuum and of standard<br>particles, and form equally a cosmological sea leading to new forms of dark matter and dark energy.<br>
