<b>Abstract</b><br>
Consider a strongly connected directed weighted network with n nodes. This paper presents compact roundtrip routing schemes<br>
<br>
with ~<br>
O( n) sized local tables4 and stretch 6 for any strongly connected directed network with arbitrary edge weights. A scheme<br>
with local tables of size ~<br>
O( -1n2/k) and stretch min((2k/2 - 1)(k + ), 8k2 + 4k - 4), for any<br>
&gt; 0 is also presented in the<br>
case where edge weights are restricted to be polynomially-sized. Both results are for the topology-independent node-name model.<br>These are the first topology-independent results that apply to routing in directed networks.<br>© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<br>

<b>1. Introduction</b><br>
This paper concerns compact roundtrip routing for strongly connected directed graphs in the <i>topology-independent</i><br>
node-name model first introduced by Awerbuch and Peleg in 1989. Most recent results in compact routing (and all<br>previous results on compact roundtrip routing in directed networks) (see, e.g., [13,14,17,18,24,25,35,39] and the<br>surveys of [19,44]) have been in a model where the routing scheme designer may assign his/her own O(log n)-<br>bit or sometimes O(log2 n)-bit node labels, dependent on network topology. That is, "i" has been renamed, not by<br>some arbitrary permutation P but by the routing scheme designer, in order to give maximum information about the<br>underlying topology of the network, and the packet destined for i arrives instead with its informative rename. An<br>alternate but equivalent formulation is that a packet destined for i arrives also with a short O(log n)-bit address in its<br>header, chosen by the compact routing scheme designer, dependent on network topology. This is equivalent because<br>the (short address, original name) pair could be assigned to rename a node. For example, if the underlying network<br>was a planar grid, in the topology-dependent model, the algorithm designer could require a packet destined for a node<br>to come addressed (or renamed) with its (x, y) coordinates.<br>
