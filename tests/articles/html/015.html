We propose that the post-glitch epoch in a Vela-type pulsar corresponds to a transition time in<br>
which the broken crust is readjusting its temperature and core-crust transition pressure after the<br>changes produced by the glitch. To describe the evolution of the pulsar in this epoch we use a<br>sequence of stationary and axisymmetric relativistic models of slowly rotating neutron stars with a<br>surface layer crust. Previously, we have formulated the matching conditions on the surface of the<br>star in terms of physical properties (total mass of the star, core-crust transition pressure,...).<br>
