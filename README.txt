About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BibTeX Bibliograpny Index Maker is an open source reference management 
application that focuses on the creation of lists of BibTeX references 
from a collection of PDF files containing scientific articles.


How does it work?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each PDF file, BibTeX Inex Maker uses xPDFâ€™s command line tools to extract 
its text. It then searches the Web for pages with information about the article 
and tries to extract reference from them.
