Summary. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing, the harnessing of idle compute cycles<br>through the Internet, offers new research challenges in the domain of distributed com-<br>puting. This paper presents CoDiP2P, a Computing Distributed architecture using the<br>P2P paradigm. CoDiP2P allows computing resources from ordinary users to be shared<br>in an open access by means of creating dynamic areas of computing resources in a<br>completely distributed, scalable and fault tolerant way. This paper discusses its system<br>architecture and evaluates its functionality by means of simulation.<br>
Keywords: Peer-to-Peer computing, p2p simulation, distributed computing, job<br>scheduling.<br>
1 Introduction<br>
During recent years, there has been an important increase in computing power<br>requirements in different research fields (life and earth sciences, chemistry, etc.).<br>Due to the expansion of the computer industry, this need has also been observed<br>in business (i.e. financial models) and domestic scenarios (i.e. games). These<br>new necessities have motivated the development of new distributed computing<br>paradigms that use Internet as a single large virtual computer, reducing the<br>elevated cost of the specialized environments, like supercomputers, needed to<br>execute these applications with high computing requirements.<br>
P2P computation [1, 2, 3] represents an emergent low-cost alternative to su-<br>
percomputers and cluster systems, providing access to distributed computational<br>resources in a scalable and fault-tolerant way. P2P architectures take advantage<br>of the under utilization of personal computers, integrating them into a plat-<br>form based on the sharing of computational resources between geographically<br>distributed equals. While the P2P paradigm can not hope to serve as a to-<br>tally general-purpose efficient parallel computer, it can still serve as an excellent<br>platform with unlimited computational resources for solving a wide variety of<br>computational problems: (1) Allowing processing-limited devices, such as wire-<br>less clients, to distribute their processing requirements to other machines in the<br>network or (2) Executing embarrassingly parallel programs or (3) Distributing<br>libraries with high computational requirements (i.e. a rendering library) through<br>Internet.<br>
