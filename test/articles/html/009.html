<b>Abstract</b><br>
The LHC is the perfect environment for the study of new physics in the top quark sector. We<br>
study the possibility of detecting signals of heavy color-octet vector resonances, through the charge<br>asymmetry, in t¯<br>
t+jet events. Besides contributions with the t¯<br>
t pair in a color-singlet state, the asym-<br>
metry gets also contributions which are proportional to the color factor f 2 . This process is par-<br>
abc<br>
ticularly interesting for extra-dimensional models, where the inclusive charge asymmetry generated<br>by Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon vanishes at the tree level. We find that the statistical sig-<br>nificance for the measurement of such an asymmetry is sizable for different values of the coupling<br>constants and already at low energies.<br>

The physics of the top quark is one of the most promising research fields at hadronic colliders such as the<br>Tevatron at Fermilab or the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Its huge mass compared with the<br>other quarks, and of the same order as the Higgs boson vacuum expectation value, suggests that it can<br>play an important role in the electroweak symmetry breaking. Since its discovery at Tevatron in 1995,<br>it has been extensively studied and its properties have been measured with better and better precision.<br>However, the optimal environment to perform top quark measurements is the LHC, due to its high energy<br>reach (14 TeV center-of-mass energy at full activity). At the LHC a great amount of top-antitop quark<br>pairs will be produced, thus allowing to develop analyses with high statistic. There, physics at the TeV<br>scale will be widely explored, carrying to a better determination of the Standard Model (SM) as well as,<br>possibly, discovery of new physics.<br>
Several models predict the existence of heavy colored resonances decaying to top-antitop quark pairs,<br>
that in principle can be detected at the LHC, like axigluons [1] and colorons [2] or Kaluza­Klein exci-<br>tations in extra dimensional models [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. So far, masses under roughly 1 TeV have been<br>
