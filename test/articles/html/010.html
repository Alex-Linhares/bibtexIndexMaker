A quasiparticle description of pure glue QCD thermodynamics at T  Tc is proposed and com-<br>
pared to recent lattice data. Given that a gas of glueballs with constant mass cannot quantitatively<br>reproduce the early stages of the deconfinement phase transition, the problem is to identify a rel-<br>evant mechanism leading to the observed sudden increase of the pressure, trace anomaly, etc. It<br>is shown that the strong decrease of the gluon condensate near Tc combined with the increasing<br>thermal width of the lightest glueballs might be the trigger of the phase transition.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
The phenomenology related to the deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to quark-gluon plasma<br>
(QGP) at high enough temperatures or densities is a very active field of research since the beginnings of QCD, with<br>pioneering works such as Refs. [1, 2]. On the experimental side, the QCD matter is currently studied in heavy-ion<br>collisions at RHIC and SPS, and results from the LHC can also be hoped in the future [3]. The results obtained<br>at RHIC so far suggest that a new phase has indeed been observed, that behaves like an almost perfect fluid rather<br>than a weakly interacting gas, as expected from phenomenological approaches [4]. On a theoretical side, much work<br>has been devoted to the understanding of the QGP, within several frameworks: Perturbative methods, quasiparticle<br>models, AdS/CFT duality, lattice QCD, . . . [5, 6].<br>
Apart from its intrinsic interest, the knowledge of the QCD equation of state (EoS) has eventually applications in<br>
astrophysics, to decide for example whether the core of some neutron stars can consist in a QGP or not, or in cosmology<br>in order to understand how and when the Universe hadronized. In principle, the most powerful nonperturbative<br>technique for such a study is lattice QCD. The EoS of pure glue SU(3) QCD has been computed on the lattice more<br>than a decade ago [7], while more detailed data have recently been obtained in Ref. [8], with gauge groups ranging<br>from SU(3) to SU(8). Many other calculations of the QCD EoS have also been performed including quarks flavors,<br>at zero chemical potential or not [6].<br>
Among the various existing phenomenological approaches, quasiparticle models rely on the assumption that the<br>
QGP can be seen as a gas of deconfined quarks and gluons. Since pioneering works [9], they have been shown to be<br>able to reproduce the various EoS computed in lattice QCD at T  Tc. It is thus tempting to apply such models to<br>
describe the QCD EoS below Tc. In that range however, the situation is less clear. Being in the confined phase, the<br>QCD matter should rather be modeled by a hadron gas. Let us focus on the pure glue case, which already captures the<br>essential physical features of the problem, without involving extra technical difficulties due to the presence of quarks.<br>Then, the hadronic matter should intuitively be thought as an ideal glueball gas whose thermodynamical features are<br>dominated by the lowest-lying glueballs: Bose-Einstein statistics tells us indeed that the contribution of a glueball<br>of mass m<br>
/T<br>
g and spin Jg is roughly proportional to (2Jg + 1)e-mg<br>
. However, by naively putting in such a model<br>
the glueball masses obtained in lattice QCD [10], one fails to reproduce the strong increase of the thermodynamical<br>

variables near Tc, as already pointed out in Refs. [11, 12]. One way of getting a model in agreement with the lattice<br>data is to assume a high-lying glueball of Hagedorn-type [11]. The exponential growth of the number of states with<br>mass mg then compensates the statistical suppression and brings a large enough contribution near Tc. But one has<br>to accept that glueballs are excitations of a closed string, which is not so obvious, partly in view of the many models<br>reproducing the lattice spectrum at zero temperature by assuming totally different frameworks [13].<br>
In this work, a new way of understanding the early stages of the pure glue phase transition (T<br>
Tc) is proposed.<br>
A Hagedorn glueball spectrum is not assumed. Therefore, only the lightest glueballs, that all models find to be the<br>scalar and tensor ones, are assumed to bring a significant contribution to the EoS. As it will be shown, two ingredients<br>
