<A name=1></a><b>Title: Towards a High Performance Computing Economy  </b><br>
<b>Presenter: Dr. Stan Ahalt, Executive Director of the Ohio Supercomputer Center </b><br>
<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Economic forces will continue to shape High Performance Computing (HPC).   It is clear <br>that the US has reached a critical juncture with regard to HPC, and the central challenge <br>will be to sustain sources of funding so that our leadership position in HPC is sustained.  <br>However, another view of this challenge might be more illuminating: can HPC be <br>realistically viewed as one of the critical economic drivers for our future?  Is this view of <br>HPC realistic?  Is it realizable?  And if HPC is one of a relatively small number of critical <br>economic differentiators, what level of national investment in HPC is justified by its <br>economic potential? <br>
I will try to answer these questions through field interviews, anecdotes, and statistics on <br>the current state of HPC.  I argue that a fundamental addition to the HPC market  -  the <br>addition of "blue collar" computing  - needs to take place in order to revitalize U.S <br>leadership in computational science, engineering and product design. <br>
<b>Biography:</b><br>
Dr. Stanley C. Ahalt was appointed Executive Director of the Ohio Supercomputer <br>Center (OSC) on July 1, 2003.   OSC provides reliable high performance computing and <br>networking infrastructure for a diverse statewide regional community that includes <br>education, academic research, industry, and state government.  Dr. Ahalt is also the <br>academic lead for Signal and Image Processing (SIP) in the Department of Defense <br>(DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Office's Programming Environment <br>and Training (HPCMO PET) initiative.  He is also a participant in the DARPA HPCS <br>program.  His research expertise lies in signal processing, data compression, and neural <br>networks, specifically in the use of high performance computing for these applications. <br>Dr. Ahalt has published more than 100 archival journal articles, conference papers, and <br>book chapters, and has served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on <br>Neural Networks.  He is a member of the Council on Competitiveness HPC Advisory <br>Committee. <br>
Dr. Ahalt has been a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering <br>at The Ohio State University (OSU).  He received the 1997 OSU Lumley Research <br>Award and the 1999 OSU College of Engineering Research Award. <br>
Prior to joining OSU, Dr. Ahalt worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories where he <br>developed industrial data products.  He received his BS and MS degrees in electrical <br>engineering from Virginia Tech and his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering <br>from Clemson University in 1986, and was elected to Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu. <br>
