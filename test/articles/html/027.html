Abstract. We provide an abstract version, in terms of lattices, of the<br>Horn query learning algorithm of Angluin, Frazier, and Pitt. To validate<br>it, we develop a proof that is independent of the propositional Horn<br>logic structure. We also construct a certificate set for the class of lattices<br>that generalizes and improves an earlier certificate construction and that<br>relates very clearly with the new proof.<br>

Introduction<br>
In the area of Learning via Queries, the most successful protocol so far is via<br>Membership and Equivalence queries. Three major algorithms for this model<br>are the L* algorithm for learning regular sets in terms of deterministic finite<br>automata [1]; the algorithm that learns monotone DNF (closely related to its<br>corresponding PAC version by Valiant [20]); and a sophisticated evolution of<br>the latter which allows for learning Horn formulas [3] (the two variants of the<br>algorithm were named HORN and HORN1 in [3] but most researchers chose to<br>call it "AFP algorithm" after the initials of the authors' names).<br>
Each of these has had a number of interesting applications. In particular, the<br>
AFP algorithm turned out to be crucial for developments in other areas such<br>as Knowledge Compilation [19], Intuitionistic Logic Programming [14] or even<br>Databases [18], and similar algorithms exist for learning from entailment [11] and<br>for learning certain description logics [12]. Related research questions, with an-<br>swers to a couple of them, are proposed in [6] and [17]; one of these contributions<br>is an alternative way of proving the correctness of the AFP algorithm.<br>
Several studies proceeded to analyze combinatorial dimensions of learnability<br>
problems (see the survey [4]); initially, they were ways of stating lower bounds<br>aiming at nonlearnability results [2]; it was later found that these dimensions<br>characterized polynomial query learnability, for specific protocols first ([9], [10],<br>[15], [16]) and in more generality later on ([4], [7], [8]). Specifically, for Mem-<br>bership and Equivalence protocols, the certificate size was shown to characterize<br>query complexity [16]. Certificates are, essentially, sets of labeled examples whose<br>correct classification requires a certain size of the representation mechanism un-<br>der study (precise definitions are given below).<br>
The algorithm for learning deterministic finite automata proceeds by gather-<br>
ing strings that lead to each of the states, plus additional strings showing how<br>each pair of states must be distinguished: in essence, they show how many states<br>
