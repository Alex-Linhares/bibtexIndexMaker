In previous work it was shown that MOND theories predict anomalously strong tidal stresses near<br>
the saddle points of the Newtonian gravitational potential. An analytical examination of the saddle<br>between two bodies revealed a linear and a non-linear solution, valid for the outer and inner regions.<br>Here we present a numerical algorithm for solving the MOND equations. We check the code against<br>the two-body analytical solutions and explore the region transitioning between them. We then<br>develop a a realistic model for the MONDian effects on the saddles of the Sun-Earth-Moon system<br>(including further sources is straightforward). For the Sun-Earth saddle we find that the two-body<br>results are almost unchanged, with corrections increasing from full to new Moon. In contrast, the<br>Moon saddle is an intrinsically three-body problem, but we numerically find a recipe for adapting the<br>two-body solution to this case, by means of a suitable re-scaling and axis re-orientation. We explore<br>possible experimental scenarios for LISA Pathfinder, and the prospect of a visit to the saddle(s)<br>at the end of the mission. Given the chaotic nature of the orbits, awareness of the full range of<br>the possibilities is crucial for a realistic prediction. We conclude that even with very conservative<br>assumptions on the impact parameter, the accelerometers are abundantly sensitive to vindicate or<br>rule out the theory.<br>
