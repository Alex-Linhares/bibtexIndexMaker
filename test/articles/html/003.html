Introduction<br>
The high accuracy and long time span of photoelectric observations allow them to<br>
be used for multifactor analyses and refining some of the "fine" photometric effects<br>in the light curves of close binary systems. The results obtained can be subsequently<br>interpreted in terms of the model of mass flow from the optical component of the<br>close binary systems onto the accretion disk of the neutron star, which can explain<br>satisfactorily the irregularities of the gaseous flow, the "hot spot", and the presence<br>of splashes moving in individual Keplerian trajectories about the outer parts of the<br>accretion disk of the neutron star Her X-1.<br>
Photometric peculiarities of the accretion formation of the neutron star Her X-1 and<br>its geometry in 1986-1990<br>
When analyzing the photometric data in during the 1986 season (fig01(a-d)), one<br>
must bear in mind that the scatter of individual measurements in the B, and espe-<br>cially, in the W filter at times exceeds, on the average, the corresponding standard<br>errors (up to 0m.30m.5), most likely, due to the physical variability of the optical<br>star, as we pointed out in our earlier papers [1], [2], [3].<br>
arXiv:0912.0706v2  [astro-ph.SR]  4 Dec 2009<br>
During the 1988 season the accretion formation in the system increased in size,<br>
resulting in an increase of the duration of the secondary minimum Min , contrary<br>to the conclusion made by Kiliachkov [4]. This discrepancy can be explained by the<br>small number of observational data points used by the above authors compared to<br>the data set that we use in this paper, and the lack of W- (or U-) and R-band in<br>the former analysis.<br>
