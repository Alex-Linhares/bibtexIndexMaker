Abstract A sketch of the proof of strong cosmic censorship is presented for a class of solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, those with polarized Gowdy symmetry. A key element of the argument is the observation that by means of a suitable choice of variables the central equations in this problem can be written in a form where they are identical to the central equations for general (i.e. non-polarized) vacuum Gowdy spacetimes. Using this it is seen that the results of Ringstr¨m o on strong cosmic censorship in the vacuum case have implications for the Einstein-Maxwell case. Working out the geometrical meaning of these analytical results leads to the main conclusion.

Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC)

From the singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose we know that singularities appear under general physically reasonable assumptions, but we do not know what happens in the singularities without a theory of quantum gravity. So if the singularities can influence what is outside, there would be a breakdown of predictability. A conjecture to solve this problem is the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis of Penrose [1]. We will use the following definition of SCC taken from [2]: Definition 1 (SCC) The maximal Cauchy development of all initial data for the Einstein-matter system belonging to an open dense subset is inextendible provided the matter model is well-behaved. 1
