ABSTRACT In this article, I obtain the Einstein and Møller energy complex in PG coordinates. According to the diﬀerence of energy within radius r between Einstein and Møller prescription, I could present the diﬀerence of energy within radius r like the fomula of Legendre transformation and propose that the Møller and Einstein energy complex play the role of internal energy and Helmholtz energy in thermodynamics.
