ABSTRACT
We invert directly the redshift - luminosity distribution of observed long Swift GRBs to obtain their rate and luminosity function. Our best fit rate is described by a broken power law that rises like (1+z)2.1-0.6 for 0 < z < 3 and decrease like (1+z)-1.4-1.0 for z > 3. This transition begins earlier and its amplitude is somewhat smaller than the corresponding transition in the SFR. The local rate is 0 1.3+0.6 [Gpc-3 yr-1 ]. -0.7
+0.5 +2.4

The luminosity function is well described by a broken power law with a break at L 1052.50.2 [erg/sec] and with indices  = 0.2+0.2 and  = 1.4+0.3 . The -0.1 -0.6

recently detected GRB 090423, with redshift  8, fits nicely into the model's prediction, verifying that we are allowed to extend our results to high redshifts. For non evolving luminosity functions we can rule out a GRB rate that follows the star formation rate (SFR), unless the latter is steeply rising at large redshifts.

INTRODUCTION

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short and intense pulses of soft -rays. In this work we study their luminosity function and their cosmic rate. Knowing these functions would help us understanding the nature of GRBs and determine their progenitors. This may also shed light on the still mysterious physics of the central engine. The luminosity function and the rate are observationally entangled as the observed rate is a convolution of the luminosity function with the cosmic rate. For this reason, almost every work before this paper must had a-priori assumptions on at least one of these functions. At first - having no motivation to belive otherwise - the rate was assumed to be constant. The simplest form for the luminosity function was a standard candle i.e. a constant luminosity. The early studies used the
