Abstract Consider a strongly connected directed weighted network with n nodes. This paper presents compact roundtrip routing schemes   with O( n) sized local tables4 and stretch 6 for any strongly connected directed network with arbitrary edge weights. A scheme  with local tables of size O( -1 n2/k ) and stretch min((2k/2 - 1)(k + ), 8k 2 + 4k - 4), for any > 0 is also presented in the case where edge weights are restricted to be polynomially-sized. Both results are for the topology-independent node-name model. These are the first topology-independent results that apply to routing in directed networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction This paper concerns compact roundtrip routing for strongly connected directed graphs in the topology-independent node-name model first introduced by Awerbuch and Peleg in 1989. Most recent results in compact routing (and all previous results on compact roundtrip routing in directed networks) (see, e.g., [13,14,17,18,24,25,35,39] and the surveys of [19,44]) have been in a model where the routing scheme designer may assign his/her own O(log n)bit or sometimes O(log2 n)-bit node labels, dependent on network topology. That is, "i" has been renamed, not by some arbitrary permutation P but by the routing scheme designer, in order to give maximum information about the underlying topology of the network, and the packet destined for i arrives instead with its informative rename. An alternate but equivalent formulation is that a packet destined for i arrives also with a short O(log n)-bit address in its header, chosen by the compact routing scheme designer, dependent on network topology. This is equivalent because the (short address, original name) pair could be assigned to rename a node. For example, if the underlying network was a planar grid, in the topology-dependent model, the algorithm designer could require a packet destined for a node to come addressed (or renamed) with its (x, y) coordinates.
