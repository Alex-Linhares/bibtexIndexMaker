ABSTRACT

The origin of Earth oceans is controversial. Earth could have acquired its water either from hydrated silicates (wet Earth scenario) or from comets (dry Earth scenario). [HDO]/[H2 O] ratios are used to discriminate between the scenarios. High [HDO]/[H2 O] ratios are found in Earth oceans. These high ratios are often attributed to the release of deuterium enriched cometary water ice, which was formed at low gas and dust temperatures. Observations do not show high [HDO]/[H2 O] in interstellar ices. We investigate the possible formation of high [HDO]/[H2 O] ratios in dense (nH >106 cm-3 ) and warm gas (T =100-1000 K) by gas-phase photochemistry in the absence of grain surface chemistry. We derive analytical solutions, taking into account the major neutral-neutral reactions for gases at T > 100 K. The chemical network is dominated by photodissociation and neutral-neutral reactions. Despite the high gas temperature, deuterium fractionation occurs because of the difference in activation energy between deuteration enrichment and the back reactions. The analytical solutions were confirmed by the time-dependent chemical results in a 10-3 M disc around a typical TTauri star using the photochemical code P RO D I M O . The P RO D I M O code includes frequency-dependent 2D dust-continuum radiative transfer, detailed non-LTE gas heating and cooling, and hydrostatic calculation of the disc structure. Both analytical and time-dependent models predict high [HDO]/[H2 O] ratios in the terrestrial planet forming region (< 3 AU) of circumstellar discs. Therefore the [HDO]/[H2 O] ratio may not be an unique criterion to discriminate between the different origins of water on Earth. Key words: Astrochemistry

1 INTRODUCTION The water deuteration abundance ratio [HDO]/[H2 O] is often used to determine the temperature at which water was synthesised. Current sub-millimeter observations already provide measurements of [HDO]/[H2 O] for many astronomical objects including comets, hot-cores, and protoplanetary discs. In particular, a high [HDO]/[H2 O] has been observed toward the protoplanetary disc DM Tau (Ceccarelli et al. 2005), although the HDO detection remains controversial (Guilloteau et al. 2006). The Herschel Space Telescope will be capable to detect cool and warm water in discs while the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will spatially resolve HDO emission. The water deuteration abundance ratio [HDO]/[H2 O] in hot cores around massive young stellar objects is  3x10-4 (Gensheimer et al. 1996), around a factor  10 enhancement compared to the cosmic [D]/[H] value set at the Big Bang ( 1.5x10-5 , Linsky 2003). The enrichment suggests that the chemistry occurs in a low density, cold medium (T < 100 K), where HDO synthesis begins with the deuteration of the molecular ion H+ into H2 D+ (e.g., Roberts & Millar 2000). Further gas-phase reactions lead to a high [HDO]/[H2 O]. But at temperatures 3 greater than 100 K, which is the typical gas temperature of hot cores, the initial deuteration reaction is inefficient and the [HDO]/[H2 O] is
