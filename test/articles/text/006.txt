Abstract
We give the approximate analytic solutions of the Dirac equations for the Rosen-Morse potential including the spin-orbit centrifugal term. In the framework of the spin and pseudospin symmetry concept, we obtain the analytic bound state energy spectra and corresponding two-component upper- and lower-spinors of the two Dirac particles, in closed form, by means of the NikiforovUvarov method. The special cases of the s-wave κ = ±1 (l = l = 0) Rosen-Morse potential, the Eckart-type potential, the PT-symmetric Rosen-Morse potential and non-relativistic limits are brieﬂy studied. Keywords: Dirac equation, spin and pseudospin symmetry, bound states, Rosen-Morse potential, Nikiforov-Uvarov method.
