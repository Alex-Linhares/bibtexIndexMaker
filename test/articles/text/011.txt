Abstract
We analyze a beta function with the analytic form of Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov result in the ﬁve dimensional gravity-dilaton environment. We show how dilaton inherits poles and ﬁxed points of such beta function through the zeros and points of extremum in its potential. Super Yang-Mills and supersymmetric QCD are studied in detail and Seiberg’s electric-magnetic duality in the dilaton potential is explicitly demonstrated. Non-supersymmetric proposals of similar functional form are tested and new insights into the conformal window as well as determinations of scheme-independent value of the anomalous dimension at the ﬁxed point are presented.
